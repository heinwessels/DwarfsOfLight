# Dwarfs Of Light
This is an implementation of a Composition based game engine, with a game built on top of it. The game is about dwarfs walking around in a dark cave with torches.


## Problems Solved
- **Circular Dependancy** between `Game` and `Systems`, where both need to access the other's members. The solution was to tell the compiler how much memory to allocate in the header using a forward declaration. Then, with the implementation a simple `include` can be used, since the memory is already allocated and the circular dependancy is solved.
  - Only store pointer or reference to the other class.
  - `Game.h` includes `System.h` *outside* the include guards.
  - `System.h` forward declares `Game.h` above the header definition.
  - In the `System.cpp` source file `#include "Game.h"` right below the `#include "System.h`.
